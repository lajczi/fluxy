# Fluxy

Fluxy is a Fluxer moderation and server-management bot written in TypeScript.

It includes:
- moderation commands (`ban`, `kick`, `warn`, `timeout`, etc.)
- automod modules (anti-link, anti-spam, anti-raid, ghost ping)
- utility/admin features (tickets, reaction roles, verification, logging, lockdown)
- optional API/dashboard integration

## Add Fluxy to your server (hosted)

**Most people should use the official hosted Fluxy**—you get updates, infrastructure, and support without running your own stack.

- **[Invite Fluxy to your server](https://web.fluxer.app/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1474069931333816428&scope=bot&permissions=4504699474930806)** — OAuth install with the recommended permissions.
- **Support & community:** [fluxer.gg/fluxy](https://fluxer.gg/fluxy) (Fluxer Discord).

This repository is for **self-hosting** Fluxy (your own VPS, MongoDB, env, and ops). If you only want the bot in Discord, use the invite link above; skip to [License](#license) / [Licensing FAQ](#licensing-faq) if you need legal detail.
