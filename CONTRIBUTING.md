## Development setup

- **Node.js** `>=22`
- **MongoDB** (local or Docker) for development
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

The dashboard lives under `dashboard/`; root `npm run build` should build both as configured in `package.json`.

## Pull requests

- Open an issue first for large changes or new features when possible.
- Keep PRs focused; smaller changes are easier to review.
- Fill out the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md).
- Ensure `npm run build` and `npm test` pass.

## Code style

- Formatting is enforced with Prettier (see `.prettierrc`).
- Prefer clear names and small, testable changes over large refactors mixed with fixes.

## Security

Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
